## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I started the use of SASS and the CUBE CSS methodology. Which was really challenging and it's OK, but not great yet.

```css
.flow > :where(:not(:first-child)) {
  margin-top: var(--flow-content, 1em);
}
```

This CSS part defines the flow between heading and paragraph with an custompropery and fallback.

### Useful resources

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) - This is a way to organise an code the CSS part of a website. For this challenges it is overkill, but it is fun to learn new approaches.
